# 6DFO-3D-printing-FP
An ongoing project consisting of 6 degrees of freedom robotic arm with mechanical, software and simulation development. It purpose, 3D manufacturing of hybrid 3D printed assisted-composite designs. Done with simulation optimized layering for manufacturing light weight, strong and resilient parts. 

In here it will be relesed updates on the project as well as examples and code for design and controll paramters of the robotic arm. As well as the topology and leyering optimization process and the layering code from a stl file of the part.
